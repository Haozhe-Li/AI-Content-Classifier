Climate change has likely led to the decline of some of Scotland's mountain plants, according to new research.

Scientists said many of the species relied on snow cover remaining high on hills until late spring and even summer to ensure a moist environment.

They also said plants that thrived on lower ground in warmer conditions were spreading to mountain habitats.

Species found to be in decline include snow pearlwort, alpine lady-fern and alpine speedwell.

The research by the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI) has taken 20 years to complete and has been published in the new Plant Atlas.

Data used to produce the report included more than three million plant records of 2,555 species collected by hundreds of botanists across Scotland.

Climate change, habitat loss and the spread of non-native species were found to key threats to the health of British and Irish native plants.

BSBI said devastating losses of species in Scotland were among the findings.

Almost the entire British population of snow pearlwort is found on Ben Lawers, but half of the Perthshire mountain's known colonies have disappeared over the last 40 years.

A final perspective focuses on justice. Fundamentally, one major reason that rural residents would need additional transportation support to reach services is the lack of public transportation available in rural areas. If public transportation were to be put into place, then the additional allocation of resources would no longer be needed. This is the work of justice—to remove whatever fundamental barrier exists that is leading to the inequity in the first place. This is often easier said than Done!, of course, but the work of social justice counteracts the need to provide unequal resources (which often makes taxpayers and legislators very uncomfortable, despite its essential nature to achieve equity).

The fundamental inequities in health that occur between sociodemographic groups in the U.S. represent some of the darkest aspects of our culture, and yet the field of health equity is strikingly new. Ultimately grounded in a historical context of racism, discrimination, injustice, disadvantage, and privilege, it is easy to become overwhelmed with the systemic nature of the issues that must be addressed to truly achieve health equity. Despite this, every day an army of community members and professionals work to do just that—change a system that has so deeply entrenched inequities into our daily lives that it was not until the 1990s that the federal government began to acknowledge the need for change. The work is hard, and at times feels painfully slow, but at the same time, it is some of the most important work being Done! in our nation.

Thomas Percy was a member of the failed Gunpowder Plot. Following King James's accession to the English throne in 1603, Percy became disenchanted with the new king, who he supposed had reneged on his promises of toleration for English Catholics. He joined Robert Catesby's conspiracy to kill the King and his ministers by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder. Percy helped fund the group and secured the leases to properties in London, including the undercroft beneath the House of Lords where the gunpowder was placed. When the plot was exposed on 5 November 1605, Percy fled to the Midlands, catching up with other conspirators travelling to Dunchurch. At the border of Staffordshire, they were besieged by the Sheriff of Worcester and his men. Percy was reportedly killed by the same musket ball as Catesby and was buried nearby. His body was later exhumed, and his head exhibited outside Parliament. (This article is part of a featured topic: Gunpowder Plot.)

Following James's accession to the English throne in 1603, Percy became disenchanted with the new king, who he believed had reneged on his promises of toleration for English Catholics. His meeting in June 1603 with Robert Catesby, a religious zealot similarly unimpressed with the new royal Stuart dynasty, led the following year to his joining Catesby's conspiracy to kill the king and his ministers by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder. Percy helped fund the group and secured the leases to certain properties in London, one of which was the undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords, in which the gunpowder was finally placed. The conspirators also planned to instigate an uprising in the Midlands and to simultaneously kidnap James's daughter, Princess Elizabeth. Percy was to remain in London and secure the capture of her brother, Prince Henry.

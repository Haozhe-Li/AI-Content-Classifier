Climate change has likely led to the decline of some of Scotland's mountain plants, according to new research.

Scientists said many of the species relied on snow cover remaining high on hills until late spring and even summer to ensure a moist environment.

They also said plants that thrived on lower ground in warmer conditions were spreading to mountain habitats.

Species found to be in decline include snow pearlwort, alpine lady-fern and alpine speedwell.

The research by the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI) has taken 20 years to complete and has been published in the new Plant Atlas.

Data used to produce the report included more than three million plant records of 2,555 species collected by hundreds of botanists across Scotland.

Climate change, habitat loss and the spread of non-native species were found to key threats to the health of British and Irish native plants.

BSBI said devastating losses of species in Scotland were among the findings.

Almost the entire British population of snow pearlwort is found on Ben Lawers, but half of the Perthshire mountain's known colonies have disappeared over the last 40 years.

A final perspective focuses on justice. Fundamentally, one major reason that rural residents would need additional transportation support to reach services is the lack of public transportation available in rural areas. If public transportation were to be put into place, then the additional allocation of resources would no longer be needed. This is the work of justice—to remove whatever fundamental barrier exists that is leading to the inequity in the first place. This is often easier said than Done!, of course, but the work of social justice counteracts the need to provide unequal resources (which often makes taxpayers and legislators very uncomfortable, despite its essential nature to achieve equity).

The fundamental inequities in health that occur between sociodemographic groups in the U.S. represent some of the darkest aspects of our culture, and yet the field of health equity is strikingly new. Ultimately grounded in a historical context of racism, discrimination, injustice, disadvantage, and privilege, it is easy to become overwhelmed with the systemic nature of the issues that must be addressed to truly achieve health equity. Despite this, every day an army of community members and professionals work to do just that—change a system that has so deeply entrenched inequities into our daily lives that it was not until the 1990s that the federal government began to acknowledge the need for change. The work is hard, and at times feels painfully slow, but at the same time, it is some of the most important work being Done! in our nation.

Thomas Percy was a member of the failed Gunpowder Plot. Following King James's accession to the English throne in 1603, Percy became disenchanted with the new king, who he supposed had reneged on his promises of toleration for English Catholics. He joined Robert Catesby's conspiracy to kill the King and his ministers by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder. Percy helped fund the group and secured the leases to properties in London, including the undercroft beneath the House of Lords where the gunpowder was placed. When the plot was exposed on 5 November 1605, Percy fled to the Midlands, catching up with other conspirators travelling to Dunchurch. At the border of Staffordshire, they were besieged by the Sheriff of Worcester and his men. Percy was reportedly killed by the same musket ball as Catesby and was buried nearby. His body was later exhumed, and his head exhibited outside Parliament. (This article is part of a featured topic: Gunpowder Plot.)

Following James's accession to the English throne in 1603, Percy became disenchanted with the new king, who he believed had reneged on his promises of toleration for English Catholics. His meeting in June 1603 with Robert Catesby, a religious zealot similarly unimpressed with the new royal Stuart dynasty, led the following year to his joining Catesby's conspiracy to kill the king and his ministers by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder. Percy helped fund the group and secured the leases to certain properties in London, one of which was the undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords, in which the gunpowder was finally placed. The conspirators also planned to instigate an uprising in the Midlands and to simultaneously kidnap James's daughter, Princess Elizabeth. Percy was to remain in London and secure the capture of her brother, Prince Henry.

Starship Troopers is a science-fiction action film released on November 7, 1997. Directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Edward Neumeier, it is based on the 1959 novel Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein (pictured). The story follows teenager Johnny Rico and his comrades as they serve in a 23rd-century interstellar war against aliens called the Arachnids. The film stars Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey, Neil Patrick Harris, Patrick Muldoon, and Michael Ironside. Starship Troopers faced critical backlash, with reviewers seeing it as endorsing fascism, and disparaging its violent content. Despite initial box-office success, negative reviews and unfavorable word of mouth made it only the 34th-highest-grossing film of 1997. It has since been critically re-evaluated, and is now considered a cult classic and a satire of fascism and authoritarianism that has grown in relevancy. The film launched a multimedia franchise, video games, comics, and a variety of merchandise.

The Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus) is a bird in the family Pelecanidae. With a length of 160 to 183 centimetres (63 to 72 inches), a mass of 7.25 to 15 kilograms (16.0 to 33.1 pounds) and a wingspan of 245 to 351 centimetres (96 to 138 inches), it is the largest pelican species and one of the world's largest living flying birds. The Dalmatian pelican has a range spanning across much of central Eurasia, from the Mediterranean in the west to the Taiwan Strait in the east, and from the Persian Gulf in the south to Siberia in the north. It is a short-to-medium-distance migrant between breeding and overwintering areas. The Dalmatian pelican's preferred habitat is lakes, rivers, deltas and estuaries, and it feeds on various fish species such as the common carp and European perch. Like many pelicans, it is often silent, but can be vocal during the mating season, engaging in a wide range of guttural, deep vocalisations, including barks, hisses and grunts. This Dalmatian pelican was photographed in flight over the Danube Delta in Romania.

The somewhat similar-looking great white pelican broadly overlaps in size but has greater size sexual dimorphism: female great whites can be noticeably smaller than female Dalmatians but male individuals of the two species are essentially the same size and weight.[8][15] However, the Dalmatian differs from this other very large species in that it has curly nape feathers, grey legs and silvery-white (rather than pure white) plumage. In winter, adult Dalmatian pelicans go from silvery-grey to a dingier brownish-grey cream colour.[17] Immature birds are grey and lack the pink facial patch of immature white pelicans. The loose feathers around the forehead of the Dalmatian pelican can form a W-like-shape on the face right above the bill.[15] In the breeding season it has an orange-red lower mandible and pouch against a yellow upper mandible. In winter, the whole bill is a somewhat dull yellow. The bill, at 36 to 45 cm (14 to 18 in) long, is the second largest of any bird, after the Australian pelican (Pelecanus conspicillatus).[15] The bare skin around the eye can vary from yellow to purplish in colour.[18] Among standard measurements, compared to the great white pelican, the Dalmatian's tarsus is slightly shorter, at 11.6 to 12.2 cm (4.6 to 4.8 in), but its tail and wing chord length are notably larger, at 22 to 24 cm (8.7 to 9.4 in) long and 68 to 80 cm (27 to 31 in), respectively.[19][20] When the Dalmatian pelican is in flight, unlike other pelicans, its wings are solid grayish-white with black tips.[15] It is an elegant soaring bird. When a whole flock of Dalmatian pelicans is in flight, all its members move in graceful synchrony, their necks held back like a heron's.

Using an isolated environment such as pip venv or conda makes it possible to install a specific version of scikit-learn with pip or conda and its dependencies independently of any previously installed Python packages. In particular under Linux it is discouraged to install pip packages alongside the packages managed by the package manager of the distribution (apt, dnf, pacman…).

Note that you should always remember to activate the environment of your choice prior to running any Python command whenever you start a new terminal session.

If you have not installed NumPy or SciPy yet, you can also install these using conda or pip. When using pip, please ensure that binary wheels are used, and NumPy and SciPy are not recompiled from source, which can happen when using particular configurations of operating system and hardware (such as Linux on a Raspberry Pi).

Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions starting with plot_ and classes ending with Display) require Matplotlib. The examples require Matplotlib and some examples require scikit-image, pandas, or seaborn. The minimum version of scikit-learn dependencies are listed below along with its purpose.

I\nterstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction drama film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where Earth is suffering from catastrophic blight and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for mankind.

The screenplay had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007 and was originally set to be directed by Steven Spielberg. Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was an executive producer and scientific consultant on the film, and wrote the tie-in book The Science of Interstellar. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm movie film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Filming began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Klaustur, and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects, and the company DNEG created additional digital effects.

On Earth in 2092, an adult Murph helps Professor Brand, Amelia's father, with a gravity equation, supposed to help transport humanity en masse to potentially habitable worlds. On his deathbed, Brand confesses the equation is unsolvable without information from inside a black hole's singularity. Murph wonders if Cooper knowingly abandoned her, but continues Brand's work. She visits her childhood home and comes across her old bookshelf.

The Endurance travels to the second candidate planet, a frigid ice world. They awaken Mann, the surviving NASA explorer in cryostasis, who landed decades ago. Mann attacks them, as he has falsified data to attract rescuers. Romilly is killed, and Cooper, Amelia and the robots, are left with a crippled spaceship, after Mann's failed docking attempt blows out a hatch and kills him. Charting a gravity-assist path around Gargantua, Cooper propels the Endurance towards the final candidate planet, losing 51 years to time dilation. He and TARS sacrifice themselves to lighten the Endurance, so that Amelia may safely reach the final planet.

Development and financing
The premise for Interstellar was conceived by the producer Lynda Obst and the theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who collaborated on the film Contact (1997), and had known each other since Carl Sagan set them up on a blind date.[8][9] The two conceived a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about "the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans", and attracted Steven Spielberg's interest in directing.[10] The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced plans for a science-fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne. Obst was attached to produce.[11][12] By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay.[13]

After Spielberg moved his production studio, DreamWorks, from Paramount to Walt Disney Studios in 2009, Paramount needed a new director for Interstellar. Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher, who joined the project in 2012.[14] Christopher Nolan met with Thorne, then attached as executive producer, to discuss the use of spacetime in the story.[15] In January 2013, Paramount and Warner Bros. announced that Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to direct Interstellar.[16] Nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal of human spaceflight,[17] and intended to merge his brother's screenplay with his own.[18] By the following March, Nolan was confirmed to direct Interstellar, which would be produced under his label Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions.[19] The Hollywood Reporter said Nolan would earn a salary of $20 million against 20% of the total gross.[20] To research for the film, Nolan visited NASA and the private space program at SpaceX.[15]

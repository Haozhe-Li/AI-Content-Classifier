Climate change has likely led to the decline of some of Scotland's mountain plants, according to new research.

Scientists said many of the species relied on snow cover remaining high on hills until late spring and even summer to ensure a moist environment.

They also said plants that thrived on lower ground in warmer conditions were spreading to mountain habitats.

Species found to be in decline include snow pearlwort, alpine lady-fern and alpine speedwell.

The research by the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI) has taken 20 years to complete and has been published in the new Plant Atlas.

Data used to produce the report included more than three million plant records of 2,555 species collected by hundreds of botanists across Scotland.

Climate change, habitat loss and the spread of non-native species were found to key threats to the health of British and Irish native plants.

BSBI said devastating losses of species in Scotland were among the findings.

Almost the entire British population of snow pearlwort is found on Ben Lawers, but half of the Perthshire mountain's known colonies have disappeared over the last 40 years.

A final perspective focuses on justice. Fundamentally, one major reason that rural residents would need additional transportation support to reach services is the lack of public transportation available in rural areas. If public transportation were to be put into place, then the additional allocation of resources would no longer be needed. This is the work of justice—to remove whatever fundamental barrier exists that is leading to the inequity in the first place. This is often easier said than Done!, of course, but the work of social justice counteracts the need to provide unequal resources (which often makes taxpayers and legislators very uncomfortable, despite its essential nature to achieve equity).

The fundamental inequities in health that occur between sociodemographic groups in the U.S. represent some of the darkest aspects of our culture, and yet the field of health equity is strikingly new. Ultimately grounded in a historical context of racism, discrimination, injustice, disadvantage, and privilege, it is easy to become overwhelmed with the systemic nature of the issues that must be addressed to truly achieve health equity. Despite this, every day an army of community members and professionals work to do just that—change a system that has so deeply entrenched inequities into our daily lives that it was not until the 1990s that the federal government began to acknowledge the need for change. The work is hard, and at times feels painfully slow, but at the same time, it is some of the most important work being Done! in our nation.

Thomas Percy was a member of the failed Gunpowder Plot. Following King James's accession to the English throne in 1603, Percy became disenchanted with the new king, who he supposed had reneged on his promises of toleration for English Catholics. He joined Robert Catesby's conspiracy to kill the King and his ministers by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder. Percy helped fund the group and secured the leases to properties in London, including the undercroft beneath the House of Lords where the gunpowder was placed. When the plot was exposed on 5 November 1605, Percy fled to the Midlands, catching up with other conspirators travelling to Dunchurch. At the border of Staffordshire, they were besieged by the Sheriff of Worcester and his men. Percy was reportedly killed by the same musket ball as Catesby and was buried nearby. His body was later exhumed, and his head exhibited outside Parliament. (This article is part of a featured topic: Gunpowder Plot.)

Following James's accession to the English throne in 1603, Percy became disenchanted with the new king, who he believed had reneged on his promises of toleration for English Catholics. His meeting in June 1603 with Robert Catesby, a religious zealot similarly unimpressed with the new royal Stuart dynasty, led the following year to his joining Catesby's conspiracy to kill the king and his ministers by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder. Percy helped fund the group and secured the leases to certain properties in London, one of which was the undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords, in which the gunpowder was finally placed. The conspirators also planned to instigate an uprising in the Midlands and to simultaneously kidnap James's daughter, Princess Elizabeth. Percy was to remain in London and secure the capture of her brother, Prince Henry.

Starship Troopers is a science-fiction action film released on November 7, 1997. Directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Edward Neumeier, it is based on the 1959 novel Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein (pictured). The story follows teenager Johnny Rico and his comrades as they serve in a 23rd-century interstellar war against aliens called the Arachnids. The film stars Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey, Neil Patrick Harris, Patrick Muldoon, and Michael Ironside. Starship Troopers faced critical backlash, with reviewers seeing it as endorsing fascism, and disparaging its violent content. Despite initial box-office success, negative reviews and unfavorable word of mouth made it only the 34th-highest-grossing film of 1997. It has since been critically re-evaluated, and is now considered a cult classic and a satire of fascism and authoritarianism that has grown in relevancy. The film launched a multimedia franchise, video games, comics, and a variety of merchandise.

The Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus) is a bird in the family Pelecanidae. With a length of 160 to 183 centimetres (63 to 72 inches), a mass of 7.25 to 15 kilograms (16.0 to 33.1 pounds) and a wingspan of 245 to 351 centimetres (96 to 138 inches), it is the largest pelican species and one of the world's largest living flying birds. The Dalmatian pelican has a range spanning across much of central Eurasia, from the Mediterranean in the west to the Taiwan Strait in the east, and from the Persian Gulf in the south to Siberia in the north. It is a short-to-medium-distance migrant between breeding and overwintering areas. The Dalmatian pelican's preferred habitat is lakes, rivers, deltas and estuaries, and it feeds on various fish species such as the common carp and European perch. Like many pelicans, it is often silent, but can be vocal during the mating season, engaging in a wide range of guttural, deep vocalisations, including barks, hisses and grunts. This Dalmatian pelican was photographed in flight over the Danube Delta in Romania.

The somewhat similar-looking great white pelican broadly overlaps in size but has greater size sexual dimorphism: female great whites can be noticeably smaller than female Dalmatians but male individuals of the two species are essentially the same size and weight.[8][15] However, the Dalmatian differs from this other very large species in that it has curly nape feathers, grey legs and silvery-white (rather than pure white) plumage. In winter, adult Dalmatian pelicans go from silvery-grey to a dingier brownish-grey cream colour.[17] Immature birds are grey and lack the pink facial patch of immature white pelicans. The loose feathers around the forehead of the Dalmatian pelican can form a W-like-shape on the face right above the bill.[15] In the breeding season it has an orange-red lower mandible and pouch against a yellow upper mandible. In winter, the whole bill is a somewhat dull yellow. The bill, at 36 to 45 cm (14 to 18 in) long, is the second largest of any bird, after the Australian pelican (Pelecanus conspicillatus).[15] The bare skin around the eye can vary from yellow to purplish in colour.[18] Among standard measurements, compared to the great white pelican, the Dalmatian's tarsus is slightly shorter, at 11.6 to 12.2 cm (4.6 to 4.8 in), but its tail and wing chord length are notably larger, at 22 to 24 cm (8.7 to 9.4 in) long and 68 to 80 cm (27 to 31 in), respectively.[19][20] When the Dalmatian pelican is in flight, unlike other pelicans, its wings are solid grayish-white with black tips.[15] It is an elegant soaring bird. When a whole flock of Dalmatian pelicans is in flight, all its members move in graceful synchrony, their necks held back like a heron's.

Using an isolated environment such as pip venv or conda makes it possible to install a specific version of scikit-learn with pip or conda and its dependencies independently of any previously installed Python packages. In particular under Linux it is discouraged to install pip packages alongside the packages managed by the package manager of the distribution (apt, dnf, pacman…).

Note that you should always remember to activate the environment of your choice prior to running any Python command whenever you start a new terminal session.

If you have not installed NumPy or SciPy yet, you can also install these using conda or pip. When using pip, please ensure that binary wheels are used, and NumPy and SciPy are not recompiled from source, which can happen when using particular configurations of operating system and hardware (such as Linux on a Raspberry Pi).

Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions starting with plot_ and classes ending with Display) require Matplotlib. The examples require Matplotlib and some examples require scikit-image, pandas, or seaborn. The minimum version of scikit-learn dependencies are listed below along with its purpose.

I\nterstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction drama film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where Earth is suffering from catastrophic blight and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for mankind.

The screenplay had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007 and was originally set to be directed by Steven Spielberg. Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was an executive producer and scientific consultant on the film, and wrote the tie-in book The Science of Interstellar. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm movie film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Filming began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Klaustur, and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects, and the company DNEG created additional digital effects.

On Earth in 2092, an adult Murph helps Professor Brand, Amelia's father, with a gravity equation, supposed to help transport humanity en masse to potentially habitable worlds. On his deathbed, Brand confesses the equation is unsolvable without information from inside a black hole's singularity. Murph wonders if Cooper knowingly abandoned her, but continues Brand's work. She visits her childhood home and comes across her old bookshelf.

The Endurance travels to the second candidate planet, a frigid ice world. They awaken Mann, the surviving NASA explorer in cryostasis, who landed decades ago. Mann attacks them, as he has falsified data to attract rescuers. Romilly is killed, and Cooper, Amelia and the robots, are left with a crippled spaceship, after Mann's failed docking attempt blows out a hatch and kills him. Charting a gravity-assist path around Gargantua, Cooper propels the Endurance towards the final candidate planet, losing 51 years to time dilation. He and TARS sacrifice themselves to lighten the Endurance, so that Amelia may safely reach the final planet.

Development and financing
The premise for Interstellar was conceived by the producer Lynda Obst and the theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who collaborated on the film Contact (1997), and had known each other since Carl Sagan set them up on a blind date.[8][9] The two conceived a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about "the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans", and attracted Steven Spielberg's interest in directing.[10] The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced plans for a science-fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne. Obst was attached to produce.[11][12] By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay.[13]

After Spielberg moved his production studio, DreamWorks, from Paramount to Walt Disney Studios in 2009, Paramount needed a new director for Interstellar. Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher, who joined the project in 2012.[14] Christopher Nolan met with Thorne, then attached as executive producer, to discuss the use of spacetime in the story.[15] In January 2013, Paramount and Warner Bros. announced that Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to direct Interstellar.[16] Nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal of human spaceflight,[17] and intended to merge his brother's screenplay with his own.[18] By the following March, Nolan was confirmed to direct Interstellar, which would be produced under his label Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions.[19] The Hollywood Reporter said Nolan would earn a salary of $20 million against 20% of the total gross.[20] To research for the film, Nolan visited NASA and the private space program at SpaceX.[15]

Mario Party DS is a 2007 party video game developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. It is the second handheld game in the Mario Party series, as well as the last game in the series to be developed by Hudson Soft, as all subsequent games have been developed by NDcube. Like most installments in the Mario Party series, Mario Party DS features characters of the Mario franchise competing in a board game with a variety of minigames, many of which utilize the console's unique features, including its built-in microphone, dual screen and touch screen mechanics, and motion sensitivity. Up to four human players can compete at a time, though characters can also be computer-controlled. Although Mario Party DS received mixed reviews, with general praise for its minigame variety and criticism for its absence of an online multiplayer mode, the game has sold more than nine million units worldwide, making it the 11th-best-selling game for the Nintendo DS.

Theatrical
Before Interstellar's public release, Paramount CEO Brad Grey hosted a private screening on October 19, 2014, at the AMC Lincoln Square 13 IMAX theater in Manhattan, New York.[87][88] Paramount then showed Interstellar to some of the industry's filmmakers and actors in a first-look screening at the California Science Center on October 22.[89] On the following day, the film was screened at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California for over 900 members of the Screen Actors Guild.[90] The film premiered on October 26 at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles,[91] and in Europe on October 29 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London.[92][93]

Interstellar was released early on November 4 in various 70 mm IMAX film, 70 mm film and 35 mm film theaters, and had a limited release in North America on November 5, with a wide release on November 7.[94] The film was released in Belgium, France, and Switzerland on November 5, the UK on November 7 and in additional territories in the following days.[95] For the limited North American release, Interstellar was projected from 70 mm and 35 mm film in 249 theaters that still supported those formats, including at least forty-one 70 mm IMAX theaters. A 70 mm IMAX projector was installed at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles to display the format. The film's wide release expanded to theaters that showed it digitally.[96] Paramount Pictures distributed the film in North America, and Warner Bros. distributed it in the remaining territories.[31] The film was released in over 770 IMAX screens worldwide, which was the largest global release in IMAX cinemas,[97][98] until surpassed by Universal Pictures' Furious 7 (2015) with 810 IMAX theaters.[99]

Computational music analysis is an important
project for a number of reasons. From a psycho-
logical point of view, systems for performing mu-
sical processes may shed light on how human
listeners perform such processes, just as computa-
tional work in vision and problem solving has led
to important insights in those domains. While re-
cent research has revealed much about listeners’
mental representations of music (Dowling and
Harwood 1986; Butler 1992), there is much to be
learned in this area. There are practical applica-
tions to automatic music analysis as well. Many
kinds of music-related tasks that computers might
perform—for example, producing a score from raw
pitch data, detecting probable errors in a score,
searching a melodic database for matches to a
query, generating an accompaniment for a melody,
or performing statistical analysis of musical styles
for the purposes of automatic composition—re-
quire an ability to process music and extract vari-
ous kinds of structure and information from it.
Extracting this information proves to be a highly
complex task.

------

Before we begin, a word is needed about the input
to the program. The input we assume is a “note
list,” giving the pitch (in integer notation, middle
C = 60) and the on-time and off-time (in millisec-
onds) of a series of notes. It is perhaps easiest to
think of this as a two-dimensional representation
with pitch on one axis and time on the other,
similar to a piano roll. Each event is represented as
a line segment on this plane, the length of the seg-
ment corresponding to the note’s duration. The
program requires no information beyond this: in
particular, it does not require other information
commonly available in scores, such as bar lines,
key signatures, rhythmic notation, and the spell-
ings of pitches.

------

The regularity rule brings up an important fea-
ture of our system. In the past, computational
analysis of rhythm has generally been divided into
two problems. One is quantization: the rounding
off of durations and time points in a piece to mul-
tiples of a common beat (see, for example, Desain
and Honing 1992). The other is metrical analysis:
imposing higher levels of beats on an existing
lower level. Models that assume a quantized input
(such as Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s) are really only
addressing the second problem. However, an im-
portant recent realization of music artificial intel-
ligence has been that quantization and meter
finding are really part of the same process. In im-
posing a low level of beats on a piece of music,
marking the onsets of events, one is in effect iden-
tifying their position and duration in terms of inte-
ger values of those beats. Most notably, Rosenthal
(1992) proposed a model that accomplishes both
low-level quantization and medium-level meter
finding. Our system is similar in this respect, per-
forming both quantization and meter finding in a
single process.

Now consider measure 4. According to the
compatibility rule, D would be the preferred root
for this segment (since the root D results in a
pitch-root relationship of 1 with pitch D). Why is
G more preferred? Intuitively, G is a “closer” har-
mony to C than D is, and should therefore be pre-
ferred in such cases. Here we introduce a simple
spatial model: the line of fifths, similar to the
circle of fifths, but extending infinitely in either
direction as shown in Figure 4. Choosing a root
for a segment is therefore a matter of mapping it
onto a point on the line of fifths. Given this
model, we can say that there is a preference for
choosing roots so that roots of nearby segments
are close together on the line. This leads to a
third rule:

------

Regarding the harmonic program, the simple al-
gorithm described above can handle the compat-
ibility rule, the ornamental dissonance rule, and
the strong-beat rule (which penalizes changes of
harmony, depending on the strength of the beat).
The dynamic programming table at each segment
only needs to be a one-dimensional array; that di-
mension is the choice of root of the segment. To
incorporate the harmonic variance rule and the
pitch-variance rule (determining the spellings of
pitches), things get a lot more complex, and we
end up with a four-dimensional table (rather than
a one-dimensional table) to fill in. Space limita-
tions prevent us from giving the details here.
In practice, the computation described above is
intractable, because the four-dimensional table
gets too large. We handle this by pruning the table
for a given segment immediately after the table for
that segment is constructed. We simply keep only
those elements that are within some constant of
the highest score in the table. We have found a
value for this constant that maintains a reasonable
speed for the system without compromising accu-
racy.

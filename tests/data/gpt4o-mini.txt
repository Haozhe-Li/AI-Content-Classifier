Climate change, the long-term shift in global temperatures and weather patterns, poses one of the greatest threats to the planet today. Primarily driven by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, climate change result from the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, causing a gradual increase in Earth’s average temperature. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching, affecting ecosystems, sea levels, and extreme weather events.

Rising global temperatures lead to melting ice caps and glaciers, contributing to sea-level rise, which endangers coastal communities and biodiversity. Additionally, climate change intensifies weather patterns, leading to more frequent and severe hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires. These events disrupt lives, destroy habitats, and threaten food and water supplies.

Mitigating climate change requires concerted global efforts, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and adopting sustainable practices. While challenges remain, individuals, governments, and organizations worldwide are increasingly recognizing the need for action. Together, through policy changes and lifestyle adjustments, we can reduce our impact on the environment and strive toward a more sustainable future for generations to come.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries and daily life through its ability to analyze data, recognize patterns, and perform tasks that traditionally required human intelligence. AI technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, enable systems to adapt and improve over time. This flexibility powers a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars and virtual assistants to medical diagnostics and personalized recommendations in online platforms.

AI’s potential benefits are vast. In healthcare, AI aids in early disease detection, supports drug discovery, and helps optimize treatment plans, saving lives and resources. In business, AI enhances efficiency by automating repetitive tasks, analyzing market trends, and improving customer service through chatbots. Moreover, AI has shown promise in tackling complex global challenges, such as climate change and food security, by optimizing resource management and energy use.

However, AI also raises ethical concerns. Issues like privacy, bias, and the potential for job displacement are significant as AI technologies become more integrated into society. Ensuring AI is used responsibly requires transparent development practices, regulatory oversight, and collaboration across fields. With responsible use, AI has the potential to improve lives and drive innovation while minimizing its risks.

Thomas Percy (1729–1811) was an English bishop, scholar, and poet best known for his influential work in preserving and popularizing old English and Scottish ballads. He was a pivotal figure in the development of English Romantic literature, and his most famous publication, *Reliques of Ancient English Poetry* (1765), is a collection of ballads and folklore he compiled and edited. This work revived interest in medieval poetry and inspired poets like Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, who were deeply influenced by Percy’s preservation of traditional storytelling and lyrical style.

Percy was also a key figure in the antiquarian movement, interested in the historical and cultural value of literature from previous centuries. Although he took some liberties with editing and embellishing the ballads, his work made a significant impact on the literary scene of the time. Beyond poetry, Percy held a respected position in the Church of England, eventually becoming the Bishop of Dromore in Ireland. Today, Thomas Percy is remembered for his role in saving traditional English poetry and inspiring the Romantic movement, helping to shape the course of English literature.

**Protecting the Earth: A Shared Responsibility**

The Earth is our home, a beautiful and complex planet that sustains life through its ecosystems, air, water, and resources. However, human activities have caused significant damage to the environment, putting our future—and that of countless other species—at risk. The need to protect the Earth has never been more urgent. It is not just an environmental issue but a moral and practical one, as our actions today will shape the world we leave for future generations.

First and foremost, protecting the Earth means addressing climate change. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial farming have increased greenhouse gas emissions, leading to rising global temperatures. This contributes to extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions in ecosystems that impact agriculture, biodiversity, and human health. By transitioning to renewable energy sources, reducing waste, and adopting more sustainable farming practices, we can mitigate these effects and preserve the planet's delicate balance.

Another crucial aspect of Earth protection is conserving natural resources. Many of the Earth’s resources—such as freshwater, forests, and minerals—are finite. Overconsumption and wasteful practices are depleting these resources at an alarming rate. To safeguard the future, we must adopt a circular economy, where we minimize waste, reuse materials, and prioritize sustainability over short-term gain. Simple actions, like reducing plastic usage, recycling, and conserving water, can have a significant impact when done collectively.

Biodiversity is another essential area of focus. The destruction of habitats, pollution, and over-exploitation of species are driving unprecedented rates of extinction. Protecting wildlife and their habitats not only preserves the intrinsic value of nature but also helps maintain the ecological processes that support all life on Earth. Establishing protected areas, promoting sustainable agriculture, and enforcing laws against poaching are steps that can protect biodiversity.

Ultimately, protecting the Earth requires a shift in mindset. It is not enough to make occasional efforts or rely on governments and organizations alone. Every individual has a role to play in reducing their environmental footprint and advocating for change. Education, innovation, and collective action can pave the way for a sustainable future.

In conclusion, the Earth is a precious gift that we must cherish and protect. Our survival depends on the health of the planet, and by taking responsible action today, we can ensure that future generations inherit a world that is vibrant, thriving, and capable of sustaining life. Protecting the Earth is not just a choice—it is a necessity.

When comparing **Delta Air Lines** (DAL) to its major U.S. competitors—**United Airlines** (UA) and **American Airlines** (AA)—several key factors distinguish each airline, and understanding Delta's advantages and disadvantages requires considering various aspects such as customer service, fleet, route network, loyalty programs, and performance. Here's a breakdown:

### **Advantages of Delta over United and American:**

1. **Customer Service & Satisfaction:**
   Delta consistently ranks highly in customer satisfaction compared to both United and American Airlines. It often receives praise for its friendly staff, better on-time performance, and overall service quality. Delta's reputation for superior customer service is reflected in numerous industry surveys and rankings.

2. **On-Time Performance:**
   Delta has a solid track record of punctuality. Historically, it has ranked among the top U.S. carriers for on-time performance and fewer cancellations. While United and American have had occasional struggles with maintaining punctuality, Delta has been seen as a more reliable choice when it comes to timely departures and arrivals.

3. **Flight Network & Global Reach:**
   While all three airlines have expansive domestic and international networks, Delta’s **global reach** and focus on key international hubs (such as Atlanta, Detroit, and Minneapolis) gives it an advantage in some international markets. Its **SkyTeam alliance** (with carriers like Air France, KLM, and Korean Air) offers extensive international connections, especially in Europe and Asia.

4. **Premium Cabin Experience:**
   Delta’s **premium cabins**—particularly **Delta One** (business class) and **Delta Comfort+** (premium economy)—are often considered superior to those of American Airlines and United. Delta One is known for its spacious, comfortable seating, high-quality amenities, and excellent in-flight service, especially on long-haul international flights. It’s generally regarded as one of the best business class experiences in the U.S. market.

5. **SkyMiles Loyalty Program:**
   Delta's **SkyMiles** program is often praised for being relatively straightforward, offering good earning potential, especially for frequent flyers. While American and United also have solid frequent flyer programs (AAdvantage and MileagePlus), Delta's loyalty program is often considered more rewarding in terms of miles redemption flexibility, partner availability, and fewer blackout dates. Delta’s miles don’t expire, unlike AA’s and United’s, which can be a significant advantage for casual travelers.

6. **Fleet Modernization and Sustainability:**
   Delta is known for having one of the youngest and most efficient fleets among major U.S. airlines. It also places a strong emphasis on **sustainability** by investing in more fuel-efficient aircraft and striving for carbon neutrality by 2030. In comparison, both United and American have older aircraft in their fleets and may face higher operational costs as a result.

7. **In-Flight Entertainment and Connectivity:**
   Delta offers **free Wi-Fi** on many flights, and it provides **entertainment options** (movies, TV shows, and games) via personal devices or seatback screens. Delta is considered a leader in offering high-quality in-flight connectivity, often ahead of American and United in this area.

### **Disadvantages of Delta Compared to United and American:**

1. **Ticket Prices & Fees:**
   Delta's fares are often **slightly higher** than those of United and American, particularly when it comes to economy tickets. While Delta provides a more comfortable flight experience overall, its **pricing structure** might not be as competitive as United's or American's for budget-conscious travelers, especially on short-haul routes.

2. **Fewer International Routes to Certain Markets:**
   While Delta has a strong international presence, particularly in Europe and Asia, it does not have the same level of market share in some regions as United or American. For example, American has a **larger presence in Latin America** and the Caribbean, while United has a dominant position in trans-Pacific routes, with more direct flights to destinations like China and Japan.

3. **Limited Regional Jet Network:**
   Delta has a large fleet of regional jets, but United and American operate more extensive regional networks through their regional affiliates. This means **fewer regional routes** or less convenient connections in certain regions for Delta travelers.

4. **More Limited Global Alliances (Compared to Star Alliance):**
   While Delta's **SkyTeam** alliance is strong, it’s generally seen as less comprehensive than **Star Alliance** (which includes United and international partners like Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, and ANA). Star Alliance offers a broader range of benefits and flight options, especially when traveling to certain parts of the world (e.g., Asia or Oceania). This could be a disadvantage for travelers who prefer the extensive partnerships Star Alliance offers.

5. **Corporate Culture:**
   While Delta is known for good customer service, some travelers report that its **corporate culture** is more rigid or hierarchical compared to United or American. United, for example, has worked hard to position itself as a more customer-friendly and innovative airline in recent years, especially under its new management. American, despite its challenges, is known for having an ambitious, aggressive approach to expanding and modernizing its service offerings.

6. **Limited Lounge Network:**
   Delta’s **Sky Club lounges** are often praised, but the airline has fewer lounges than United (United Clubs) and American (Admirals Club), which can be a disadvantage for travelers seeking exclusive access during layovers or before flights. Additionally, Sky Club access is not as easily obtainable for passengers without higher-tier loyalty status or expensive credit cards.

### **Conclusion:**
Overall, Delta Air Lines is recognized for its **exceptional customer service**, **on-time performance**, and **premium cabin offerings**, making it a strong choice for travelers seeking reliability and a high-quality flying experience. However, it can be more expensive than United and American, particularly for economy fares, and its network may not be as extensive in some international regions.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on individual priorities: for **premium service and reliability**, Delta is often the top contender; for **lower fares and a broader route network**, United or American might be more appealing.

**Hong Kong** officially **returned to China** on **July 1, 1997**. This event marked the end of British colonial rule over the territory, which had lasted for 156 years. The transition was governed by the principle of **"one country, two systems"**, an arrangement that allowed Hong Kong to maintain a high degree of autonomy, including its own legal system, economy, and certain freedoms, for 50 years after the handover.

Under this principle, China promised that Hong Kong would retain its existing way of life, including freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press, which were not guaranteed on the mainland. The **Sino-British Joint Declaration**, signed in 1984, outlined the terms of the handover and the autonomy Hong Kong would have post-1997.

However, in recent years, there has been increasing concern about the erosion of these freedoms and autonomy, as Beijing has taken a more direct role in Hong Kong’s political and legal affairs, especially with the imposition of the **National Security Law** in 2020.

Climate change, the long-term shift in global temperatures and weather patterns, poses one of the greatest threats to the planet today. Primarily driven by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, climate change results from the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, causing a gradual increase in Earth’s average temperature. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching, affecting ecosystems, sea levels, and extreme weather events.

Rising global temperatures lead to melting ice caps and glaciers, contributing to sea-level rise, which endangers coastal communities and biodiversity. Additionally, climate change intensifies weather patterns, leading to more frequent and severe hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires. These events disrupt lives, destroy habitats, and threaten food and water supplies.

Mitigating climate change requires concerted global efforts, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and adopting sustainable practices. While challenges remain, individuals, governments, and organizations worldwide are increasingly recognizing the need for action. Together, through policy changes and lifestyle adjustments, we can reduce our impact on the environment and strive toward a more sustainable future for generations to come.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries and daily life through its ability to analyze data, recognize patterns, and perform tasks that traditionally required human intelligence. AI technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, enable systems to adapt and improve over time. This flexibility powers a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars and virtual assistants to medical diagnostics and personalized recommendations in online platforms.

AI’s potential benefits are vast. In healthcare, AI aids in early disease detection, supports drug discovery, and helps optimize treatment plans, saving lives and resources. In business, AI enhances efficiency by automating repetitive tasks, analyzing market trends, and improving customer service through chatbots. Moreover, AI has shown promise in tackling complex global challenges, such as climate change and food security, by optimizing resource management and energy use.

However, AI also raises ethical concerns. Issues like privacy, bias, and the potential for job displacement are significant as AI technologies become more integrated into society. Ensuring AI is used responsibly requires transparent development practices, regulatory oversight, and collaboration across fields. With responsible use, AI has the potential to improve lives and drive innovation while minimizing its risks.

Thomas Percy (1729–1811) was an English bishop, scholar, and poet best known for his influential work in preserving and popularizing old English and Scottish ballads. He was a pivotal figure in the development of English Romantic literature, and his most famous publication, *Reliques of Ancient English Poetry* (1765), is a collection of ballads and folklore he compiled and edited. This work revived interest in medieval poetry and inspired poets like Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, who were deeply influenced by Percy’s preservation of traditional storytelling and lyrical style.

Percy was also a key figure in the antiquarian movement, interested in the historical and cultural value of literature from previous centuries. Although he took some liberties with editing and embellishing the ballads, his work made a significant impact on the literary scene of the time. Beyond poetry, Percy held a respected position in the Church of England, eventually becoming the Bishop of Dromore in Ireland. Today, Thomas Percy is remembered for his role in saving traditional English poetry and inspiring the Romantic movement, helping to shape the course of English literature.
